    <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol>
           <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
               Start by making the unicorn's horn and ears – they'll need to dry completely before use.<br>
               Roll 225g white fondant into a long sausage shape, with one end slightly thicker than the other.<br>
               Starting from the thicker end, twist the sausage into a tight coil until you have a horn shape.<br>
               Pinch the small end upwards into a pointed tip. Next, divide the remaining white fondant into two pieces.<br>
               Roll each one out into a rough oval on a sheet of baking parchment, then pinch the top end of each oval upwards to make a point.<br>
               Set the ears aside with the horn and leave to dry while you make the cake.</li>

           <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter the base of three 20cm sandwich tins and line with baking parchment.<br>
               Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric whisk for 8-10 mins until pale and fluffy.<br>
               Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift in the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt, and fold in using a large metal spoon.<br>
               Add just enough of the milk to create a soft dropping consistency.</li>
               
           <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Divide the batter between the prepared tins and smooth the tops with a spatula.<br>
               Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 25-30 mins, or until golden and firm to the touch. Leave to cool slightly in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

           <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li><br>While the cake is cooling, make the buttercream.<br>
               Beat the butter, icing sugar and vanilla together until pale and fluffy, beating in 4-6 tbsp hot water to loosen the mixture if necessary.

           <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li><br>Put one of the cooled sponges on a cake board or stand and spread a little of the buttercream on top using a palette knife.<br>
               Gently spread over half the salted caramel, if using, then sandwich with another sponge.<br>
               Repeat the process with a little more buttercream, the remaining salted caramel (if using) and the third sponge. Spread the outside of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream – this doesn't have to be neat.<br>
               Chill for 30 mins.

           <li><strong>Step 6</strong><br>Spread a thick, even layer of buttercream over the chilled cake using a palette knife.<br>
               Divide the remaining buttercream into three bowls and colour each one differently using the gel food colouring.<br>
               Ours were light pink, purple and dark pink.</li>

           <li><strong>Step 7</strong><br>Spread a thick, even layer of buttercream over the chilled cake using a palette knife.<br>
                Divide the remaining buttercream into three bowls and colour each one differently using the gel food colouring.<br>
                Ours were light pink, purple and dark pink.</li>

           <li><strong>Step 8</strong><br>Fit three piping bags with three different nozzles (we used a round nozzle and two different-sized star nozzles) and fill each with a different colour of buttercream.<br>
               Pipe each colour around the ears and horn and all over the top of the cake, coming down one side and over the edge of the front – this is the unicorn's mane.<br>
               Decorate with some sprinkles, if using.</li>

           <li><strong>Step 9</strong><br>Divide the black fondant in two pieces, and roll each into a thin sausage shape. Shape each into an arch, then press onto the front of the cake for eyes.<br>
               If you like, curve the outer edges of the eyes upwards for eyelashes. Cut into slices and serve.<br>
               Will keep in the fridge for up to three days.</li>

    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <p>For the cake:</p>
    <ul class="listE1">
        <li>2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (270 grams)</li>
        <li>1 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened non-alkalized (85 grams)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>For the Cake:</p>
       <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F).<br>
              Spray two 9-inch round baking pans with non-stick baking pray.
              Line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper.<br>
              Then spray the parchment paper with non-stick baking spray. Set aside.<li><br>

          <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>In a large bowl sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li><br>

          <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer,<br>
              beat the butter at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute.</li><br>
                
          <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Gradually add in both sugars, one at a time, and beat until the sugar has been incorporated into the butter.<br>
              increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.<br>
              You may need to stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl once in a while to ensure no butter is getting stuck.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>Add in the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.<br>
              Add in the vanilla extract and beat until combined.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 6</strong><br>In a spouted measuring cup, combine the oil and sour cream. </li>

          <li><strong>Step 7</strong><br>On the lowest speed setting available, add the flour in three additions, alternating with the sour cream mixture, in two addition, beating until just combined!<br>
            You should still see the lightest trail of dry ingredients when you stop the mixer. </li>

          <li><strong>Step 8</strong><br>Pour in the hot coffee and let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 30 seconds. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently stir until the batter is just evenly combined.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 9</strong><br>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans (around 850 grams per pan) and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 10</strong><br>in preheated oven for 38 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 11</strong><br>Place the cakes, in the pans, on a wire rack and cool for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
       </ol>

    <p>For the Chocolate Frosting:</p>
       <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Finely chop the chocolate using a large chef's knife.<br>
              Place the chopped chocolate into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. </li>

          <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>In a small saucepan heat the cream and corn syrup over medium-high heat until the mixture comes just short of a rolling boil.<br>
              Remove the pan from heat and pour over the chopped chocolate.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Allow the mixture to sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes.<br>
              Then, using a rubber spatula or metal spoon, gently stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy.<br>Stir in the vanilla.</li>

          <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>With the mixer on medium-speed, add in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition,<br>
              and not adding more until the first addition has been completely incorporated into the frosting. Beat in the salt. </li>

          <li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>Refrigerate the frosting, loosely covered, for about 1 hour, or until it's firm enough to spread.<br>
              Frosting may be made up to 24 hours in advance and stored, covered, in the fridge.<br>
              You'll need to let it come to room temperature before using. </li>
       </ol>
    
    <p>Assembly</p>
       <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Using a long, serrated knife, slice off the domed top of each cake layer so it is smooth and even.<br>
              Then slice each cake in half horizontally, so that you have 4 even layers.<br>
              Set all of the cake scraps aside, we'll use those later to decorate! </li>

          <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Place one cake layer on a large plate or cake stand.<br>
              Spread 1/2 cup of the frosting on top of the cake, covering it completely.<br>
              Then top with another cake layer, and repeat the layering process, ending with the last cake layer on top.<br>
              Spread all remaining frosting  over the top and sides of the cake. </li>

          <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Using your hands, crumble up the remaining cake scraps until they're in fine crumbs.<br>
              Pat the crumbs gently around the sides of the cake.<br>
              You might have leftovers, which you may discard or enjoy as a snack! </li>

          <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Allow the cake to set for 20 minutes before slicing.<br>
            Then serve, or store, in the refrigerator, for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving! </li>
